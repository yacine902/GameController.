# GameController.
The project is a simple way to turn your phone into a game controller that will make the game on your computer more interactive and enjoyable.
In this simple project we'll learn how to use the accelerometer sensor of an android phone, and how to simulate keyboard key presses and mouse clicks and moves and also how to establish a Bluetooth connection between the phone and the computer to transmit the signals.
In this project we will use MIT App Developer to design the phone app and java for the computer part code.
